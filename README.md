# Consider Labs
This repository contains exploratory Consider.it applications in various stages of development.

For now this code is *not* open sourced but I will probably do so. 



## Installation notes (mac)
* I prefer using nvm over homebrew for installing and managing Node installation: https://helpmonks.com/blog/switching-brew-nvm-node-install/
* I use pm2 to manage the various prototypes running on my machine: https://pm2.keymetrics.io/
* ngrok is great for enabling other people / devices to access your code running on your local machine: https://ngrok.com/
* These prototypes use sqlite as a database. sqlite comes bundled with Mac OS. 
* Statebus is extensively used in the code: https://stateb.us/
